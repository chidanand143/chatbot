ðŸ¤– Rule-Based Chatbot Simulation

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This project delivers a basic rule-based chatbot written in Python. Its primary function is to demonstrate core programming concepts like input/output loops and conditional logic (if-elif-else) to simulate conversational responses. It serves as an introductory example to the fundamental structure of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.

âœ¨ Features
 * Conversational Loop: Runs continuously until the user explicitly tells it to exit.
 * Keyword Matching: Analyzes user input for specific keywords (e.g., "hello", "python", "bye") to generate relevant responses.
 * Default Responses: Includes a set of randomized fallback responses for inputs that don't match any defined rules.
 * Simple Logic: The response flow is entirely managed by if-elif-else blocks, making the logic transparent and easy to extend.

âš™ Prerequisites
You only need Python 3 installed to run this script. No external libraries are required, as it uses only standard modules (sys, random).

ðŸš€ How to Run and Interact
  1. Save the Script
  Save the provided code as chatbot.py.
  2. Execute from Terminal
  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:
  python chatbot.py

ðŸ›  Technology Stack
 * Language: Python
 * Core Concepts: while loops, input() function, if-elif-else conditional statements.
 * Modules: sys (for exiting), random (for default responses).
